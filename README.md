### X1-Blockcore - The X1 Blockchain Fullnode in C#

X1 is a fork of XDS at block 163300, introducing a new, innovative PoS/PoW Ratchet block verification consensus and new PoS and PoW difficulty adjustment algorithms. Proof-of-Stake is required for all even block heights, and Proof-of-Work is required for all odd block heights. This eliminates certain PoS attack strategies in other mixed PoS/PoW protocols, while keeping the chain safe from PoW-typical attacks via rented hash power. In addition to that, SegWit v1 / Taproot outputs are now whitelisted.
